      <h1>The Beagle Blog</h1>
      <p>The <strong>Beagle</strong> is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. The <strong>beagle</strong> was developed primarily for hunting hare, known as beagling. Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking instincts, the <strong>beagle</strong> is the primary breed used as a detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The <strong>beagle</strong> is intelligent and is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems.</p>
